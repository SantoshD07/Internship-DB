# Abstract

Websites are one of the primary uses of the internet, almost everything done on the internet,
is linked to a website in one way or another. Websites linked with databases allows for the
whole world to access information freely in a digestible manner.
Ease of use and convenience are the main criteria for enhanced performance of a website.
Websites integrated with a database are used universally to retrieve, acquire & display
information and store them centrally and securely.
This allows for users to access large amounts of data without storing it locally, and with little
and very minimal system requirements. This increases the accessibility and makes it feasible
for a larger number of users to access.


# Introduction

In most colleges, successful completion of the course almost always includes the completion
of an internship , attending various interviews and at the very end, getting recruited into a
company. This has been a long standing process and with nearly 3.66 crore students
graduating every year (AISHE by MHRD 2017-2018), it becomes increasingly hard for the
students to assess their options and pick where they would like to apply, and where they
should focus their efforts on. It also becomes harder for interested companies as they have to
sieve through an ever increasing number of graduates every year, this makes it harder for
them to pick students, while also raising the chance of missing well qualified potential
employees. Internship & placement management database is a simple website that aims to
ease this issue.
